# Team JSHD -A1 Blameless Post-mortem:

- What goals have been achieved?
  - A github repo is created with our team members for the project
  - We have a node project that is runnable and has a simple test suite
  - Dependencies should be ready to install in one command
  - Running the project takes only one command after dependencies are built
  - Running test suites takes only one command after dependencies are built
  - Project functionality and test coverage is not required for this milestone
  - The project is containerized in Docker
  - Project is hosted on Heroku, deployed with our docker image
    - A readme is provided in top level directory of the repo with instructions on installing and running the project
    - A summary of our tech stack and the relevant decision making
    - Milestones of the project with member ownership of each step
    - Directions to our collection of meeting notes

- Why did it go right?
  - Had clear responsibilities, which were assigned early
  - We kept records of meeting notes
  - Scope was relatively small, and didn't overestimate capacity
  - Team members helped each other when facing difficulty
  - Each part of the process had a team member that was familiar with it

---

- What goals have been missed, and by how much?
  - All of our original goals were met

- What could improve?
  - We crammed meetings towards the end, we will change to have weekly meetings
  - Meetings were not structured well, we will make sure we're prepared before the meeting starts

---

- What, if any, adjustments or decisions need to be made in light of what we have learned about project scope and capacity, in particular what plans will need to be adjusted, based on remaining time available and project scope?
  - We will have to version the application when we update or delete guideline records, which is a feature our partner informed us about after deciding the initial milestones
    - We don't think this will significantly change our scope or introduce any risks to our project
